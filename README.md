# Module 5: PyBer with Matplotlib

## Overview of the Analysis

### Purpose
The purpose of this assignment was to perform an analysis on the rideshare data and create a visualization displaying the total fares by city type over a span of four months. First, the Pandas library was used to create a summary for the rideshade data by city types. Then, a multi-line chart was created using Pandas and matplotlib to display the total fares for each city type over four months. 

### Resources
* Software: Jupyter Notebook, Python 3.7.13, Pandas library, Matplotlib library
* Data Sources: [city_data.csv](https://github.com/daniel-sh-au/UofT_DataBC_Module05_PyBer-Analysis/blob/main/Resources/city_data.csv), [ride_data.csv](https://github.com/daniel-sh-au/UofT_DataBC_Module05_PyBer-Analysis/blob/main/Resources/ride_data.csv)
* Challenge Code: [Pyber_Challenge.ipynb](https://github.com/daniel-sh-au/UofT_DataBC_Module05_PyBer-Analysis/blob/main/PyBer_Challenge.ipynb)

## Results
Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)
